# VISC

In Flutter applications, there are several ways to handle API requests, one of which is by using an available package called 'dio package' https://pub.dev/packages/dio or 'Http package' https://pub.dev/packages/http. When using the dio package, there are numerous features available within it.
The package attempts to simplify the usage of the dio package. The simplicity lies in users only needing to define the base URL, headers, and log usage.

## Plugins

Visc is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin          | Soucre                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Dio             | https://pub.dev/packages/dio             |
| Dio Smart Retry | https://pub.dev/packages/dio_smart_retry |
| Http            | https://pub.dev/packages/http            |
| Either Dart     | https://pub.dev/packages/either_dart     |
| Logger          | https://pub.dev/packages/logger          |
| DCM             | free version before paid version 5.3.0   |

## Development

I would be very happy and hopeful if all of you could review and improve what is lacking in this package for various reasons.
